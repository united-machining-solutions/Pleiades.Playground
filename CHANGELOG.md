## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Timeseries: API (REST, MCP) and persistence worker (MQTT to API).
- Events: API (REST, MCP) and persistence worker, for notification events.
- Simulator for values, states and notifications of several machines.
- Shared libraries for logging, JSON, authorization, health checks, MQTT and the MCP server standard.
- Demo stack (`compose.yaml`), contracts and CI.
- TypeScript workspace for `apps/` and `packages/`: pinned Node.js and pnpm, one version catalog, a shared
  TypeScript configuration and a CI job.
- Generative UI backend `genui-mcp` in the demo stack on port 5520: an MCP server with the tool
  `genui_machine_list`, which reads the Timeseries and Events APIs.
- Example application `playground-app` (TanStack Start, shadcn/ui) in the demo stack on port 5600. Home lists
  what every machine does now, with the values of `genui_machine_list`. A chat next to the page (TanStack AI
  harness, any OpenAI-compatible model) answers questions with the same tools.

### Changed

- MQTT: MQTTnet 5 replaces MQTTnet 4. MQTTnet 5 ships no managed client, so `Pleiades.Playground.Mqtt.Extensions`
  now carries its own `ManagedMqttClient`: it reconnects every 10 s, subscribes again on every new connection
  and queues outgoing messages while there is none. Topics, payloads and content types on the broker are
  unchanged.
